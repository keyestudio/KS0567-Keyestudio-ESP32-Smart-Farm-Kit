**Pass the wire of Water Pump through the Hole 11 in the way as shown
below:**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/image086.png
   :alt: img

The red wire of the water pump is connected to the middle terminal of
the relay module, and the black wire is connected to the GND of the
ESP32 board.

In addition, you need to use a Dupont wire to connect the left terminal
of the relay module to the 3.3V of the ESP32.

After the above steps, note that all the wiring has been finished. And
wires of the LED, water level sensor, soil humidity sensor, buzzer and
relay water pump have respectively passed through the holes of 7, 11,
13, 17 and 40 carved on the basswood board, preparing for the subsequent
installation.

4.1 Project : Lighting System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Let's start our first project, lighting system.**

--------------

Lighting up an LED is one of the most fundamental Arduino practice.

This start-up lesson is designed for beginners to understand hardware
and software programming on ESP32 development board and to master basic
circuit and programming knowledge.

Therefore, our tutorial guidance is simple. And this intriguing project
can be applied in actual scenarios at home or in office.

In this project, you will have learned the basic connections and
settings of the ESP32 development board in the Arduino programming.
What's more, some functions will also be presented for you, such as
lighting on/off an LED via the output level of a digital pin or by a
button.

.. _4.1.2-Light-up-an-LED:

4.1.2 Light up an LED
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description:**

LED, short for Light Emitting Diode, is a solid-state semiconductor that
converts electrical energy into visible light, so it is also called
solid-state lighting.

When current passes through an LED, it light up.

**Various LED:**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou1.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**LED module** is a device to output, whose brightness and blinks can be
controlled. For how to use, you only need to directly plug it into
digital output pins on the development board.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou12.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**Working principle:**

When S is at a high level, Q1 triode is into conduction, and VCC voltage
passes through LED to light up it.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/couy1.png
   :alt: img

**Parameters:**

-  Voltage: 3~5V
-  Current: ≤1.5mA
-  Power: 0.07W

--------------

**Wiring Diagram:**

**Connect the LED module to io27.**

**Attention: Connect yellow to S(Signal), red to V(Power), and black to
GND. Do not reverse them!**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/couj1.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**Test Code:**

-  Open Kidsblock and choose the correct device and port.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st1.png
      :alt: img

-  Drag |image19| from |image20| to the code editing area. Code Blocks
   execute only when they are in this area.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st12.png
      :alt: img

-  With this block, when booting the development board, code will run.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st11.png
      :alt: img

-  In |image21|, drag “\ **forever**\ ” and paste it below the previous
   block. Block “\ **forever**\ ” indicates a loop.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st20.png
      :alt: img

-  Drag an "**LED pin output**" block from |image22| and paste it in
   “\ **forever**\ ”. Set the pin to IO27 and output level to HIGH, so
   that the LED pin will continue to output high level.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st21.png
   :alt: img

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st22-1.png
   :alt: img

-  Add a 1s delay. Duplicate the "**LED pin output**" block but set the
   output to LOW, and also add a delay. Then LED will light up and go
   off in circulation.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st22.png
      :alt: img

**Test Result:**

LED blinks per second, because io27 on ESP32 board outputs high and low
level alternatively every second. Besides, various interactive
applications can also be realized via an LED, like breathing LED, water
flow lights and flashing police light.

**Expansion: Breathing LED**

**Description:**

IO interfaces of MCU (arduino UNO, ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico) output
only digital signals (high or low level). For instance, in previous
experiment (light up an LED), the digital outputs are only HIGH(3.3V)
and LOW(0V).

If MCU outputs a high level of 3.3V or a low level of 0V, the input
voltage should be at 0~3.3V. Thus, PWM (**Pulse Width Modulation**) is
needed to output different voltage value, which is called "analog
output".

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou1k1.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**Knowledge:**

What is PWM?

PWM contains three elements: Frequency(Hz), Period, Duty Cycle(%).

-  **PWM Frequency (f):** the times of signal changing from high to low
   and return to high within one second. Generally speaking, Frequency
   is the number of PWM Period in a second.

-  **PWM Period (T):** Period = 1 / Frequency (T=1/f, and 1 means 1
   second). For instance: f = 50Hz, so T = 20ms, which implies there are
   50 times of Period per second.

-  **PWM Duty Cycle:** the time ratio of HIGH to the whole Period. If
   Period = 10ms and 8ms is pulse width time, Low level occupies 2ms, so
   the Duty Cycle = 8/(8+2) = 80%.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou1k2.png
   :alt: img

**Conclusion: At an appropriate signal frequency, PWM changes effective
output voltage by changing the duty cycle in one period.** In plain
English, within a specified time, the more high level the IO port
outputs, the greater PWM value is, and the lighter LED will be.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou1k3.png
   :alt: img

**Test Code:**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st23.png
   :alt: img

-  Define a variable **item** and assign it to 0.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st25.png
      :alt: img

-  Drag a "**forever**" block and paste a "**repeat**" block in it. Set
   repeat times to 255.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st26.png
      :alt: img

-  Drag a "**variable mode**" block in "**repeat**" and set the mode to
   “\ **++**\ ”, which means **item** will increase 1 after each
   execution.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st27.png
      :alt: img

-  Find the block to set PWM which is contained in |image23| as shown
   below, so you only need to set corresponding pin and analog value to
   output PWM.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st28.png
      :alt: img

   -  Set LED pin:

      .. image:: ./scratch_img/st29.png
         :alt: img

   -  Set channel: (16 channels in total: including 0~15)

      .. image:: ./scratch_img/st30.png
         :alt: img

   -  Set PWM output value to **item**, which will automatically add 1
      from 0 to 255. **PWM output is 0~255, so we set the repeat times
      to 255.**

      .. image:: ./scratch_img/st31.png
         :alt: img

-  Add a delay to 0.01s, so that LED will light up gradually rather than
   all of a sudden.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st32.png
      :alt: img

-  Duplicate the "**repeat**" block as follows, but set mode to
   "**－－**", which decreases variable **item** each time. And LED will
   dim gradually.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st33.png
      :alt: img

**Test Result**

LED lights up and dims gradually; it breathes evenly.

.. _4.1.4-A-Button:

4.1.4 A Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

**Button Module** is a device to input. MCU reads its power level to
detect whether the button is pressed.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou13.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**Schematic Diagram:**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/couy12.png
   :alt: img

**Parameters:**

-  Voltage: 3~5V
-  Current: ≤1.1mA
-  Power: ≤5.5mW

--------------

**The principle of the button module is a circuit controlled by this
button.**

-  **When the button is pressed**, the circuit is in closed state so
   that current passes through the button to GND, which causes the
   digital input pin to detect a low level.
-  **When the button is released**, the circuit is cut and pin level
   increases due to a pull-up resistor, which makes the digital pin to
   detect a high level.

--------------

**Wiring Diagram:**

**Connect the button module to io5**

**Attention: Connect yellow to S(Signal), red to V(Power), and black to
GND. Do not reverse them!**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/couj12.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**Test Code**

-  Initialize the serial port first of all, and set baud rate to 115200.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st36.png
      :alt: img

-  Set pin to IO5 and mode to input. What follows it is a "**forever**"
   block.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st37.png
      :alt: img

-  Read the power level of digital pin 5. If it is 1, print 1. Or else,
   print 0.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st38.png
      :alt: img

Complete code:

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st35.png
   :alt: img

**Test Result**

Open serial monitor and set the corresponding baud rate.

When the button is released, the value is 1; if you press the button, it
becomes 0.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st39.png
   :alt: img

In KidsBlock, we can read the state of the digital input pin by
programming to detect whether the button is pressed. Thus, loads of
interactive applications can be realized via a button module, such as
LED on/off and display brightness adjustment.

--------------

**Expansion: Auto-locking Button**

An auto-locking button won't pop up when you press it without holding,
and it never pops up unless you press it again. It works like a switch.
For regular buttons, such function can be realized via MCU and software.

**Test Code**

-  Define two variables: **item** as the read button value and
   **button** as the value shifted by button.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st40.png
      :alt: img

-  Assign the read button value to **item**.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st41.png
      :alt: img

-  Determine whether the button is pressed. If it is, shift the value of
   **button** and print it.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st43.png
      :alt: img

   -  Delay 0.01s to eliminate the button jitter.

      -  If a close state is detected at the button, a delay will be
         executed to eliminate **Front Porch Jitter**. Generally, the
         delay is within 5ms～10ms (Mechanical properties decide). After
         the jitter disappears, check the button state again. If the
         closed state level is still maintained, it is confirmed that
         there is a button pressed.
      -  When a released button is detected, a delay of 5ms～10ms also
         should happen to remove the **Back Porch Jitter**, so that the
         program for the button can be executed.

-  When the button is pressed, **button** equals 1. Press it again,
   **button** shifts to 0, alternatively.

Complete code:

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st44.png
   :alt: img

**Test Result**

Upload code and open the serial monitor.

When you press the button once, 1 will be displayed. If you press button
for the second time, the value becomes 0. Now, a common button boasts
the function of an auto-locking one.

.. _4.1.3-Lighting-Control:

4.1.3 Lighting Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

In above basic experiments, we remould an auto-locking button to control
the LED. An auto-locking button is suitable for any situations where a
certain state needs to be maintained, for example, when LED needs to
light up for a long time, the ESP32 development board is required for
some operations.

In this experiment, we will adopt Arduino ESP32 board to guide you to
implement a lighting system and simulate real-life scenes to control
light via the button.

--------------

**Wiring Diagram:**

**Connect the button to io5 and LED to io27**

**Attention: Connect yellow to S(Signal), red to V(Power), and black to
GND. Do not reverse them!**

--------------

**Test Code:**

Code Flow:

.. image:: ./scratch_img/flo1.png
   :alt: img

Complete code:

Based on the code for Auto-locking Button, we add "**LED pin output**"
blocks.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st47.png
   :alt: img

**Test Result:**

**When you press the button once, LED lights up; if you press again, LED
turns off. This operation is a loop, which is consistent with the
lighting principle in reality.**

--------------

In this chapter, we have demonstrated how to program and control via
KidsBlock, and we have learned the basics as well as some software and
hardware concepts in experiments such as auto-locking button and
lighting control system.

These are essential for a good KidsBlock developer. Next, we will guide
you to keep exploring more applications and skills, whether you are a
beginner or a veteran. Hope you enjoy the fun and challenges during
learning KidsBlock. Let's move on!

.. _4.2-Project-:-Light-Control-System:

4.2 Project : Light Control System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this project, we will construct a light control system by a
photoresistor and an LED. It is an intelligent system to adjust light,
which saves energy and enhance efficiency as well.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cout2.png
   :alt: img

This system is compatible with multiple conditions. Thanks to its
photoresistor, it is able to detect the light intensity in day or at
night, realizing a more intelligent and energy-saving system.

When the photoresistor detects that ambient brightness is lower than the
set value, LED lights up. On the contrary, if the ambient light
intensity is higher than the set value, photorisistor will send a
different signal to turn off the LED.

.. _4.2.2-Photoresistor:

4.2.2 Photoresistor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description:**

A photoresistor, also called photosensor, converts light signal into
electric signal (voltage, current, and resistor).

**Working principle:**

We place a photoresistor in a circuit in series connection and add
suitable voltage to both poles. When there is no light, the resistance
is infinite and the circuit almost opens. However, when there is light,
the resistance decreases while the current increases, and it is
equivalent to a short circuit when the light intensity is sufficient.

Now we will read the value of photoresistor by programming on ESP32
development board.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou2.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**Schematic Diagram:**

When light hits the photoresistor, the stronger the light is, the
smaller the resistance will be, so the greater the VCC voltage will pass
through the resistor.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/couy21.png
   :alt: img

**Parameters:**

-  Voltage: 3~5V

-  Current: 0.2mA

-  Power: 1mW

-  Spectrum Peak Value: 540nm

-  Bright Resistance (10lux): 5~10KR

-  Dark Resistance: 0.5MR

--------------

**Wiring Diagram:**

**Connect the photoresistor to io34.**

**Attention: Connect yellow to S(Signal), red to V(Power), and black to
GND. Do not reverse them!**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/couj21.png

--------------

**Test Code:**

-  Initialize the serial port.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st48.png
      :alt: img

-  Define a global variable "**item**" as the photoresistor value.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st49.png

**Test Result:**

Open the serial monitor.

The brighter the light detected by the photoresistor is, the greater the
value will be.

--------------

**Test Code:**

Code Flow:

.. image:: ./scratch_img/flo2.png
   :alt: img

-  Determine:

   -  The value of the photoresistor >= 800, LED turns off.
   -  The value of the photoresistor =< 800, LED turns on.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st53.png
      :alt: img

Complete code:

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st54.png
   :alt: img

**Test Result:**

When the value of the photoresistor is greater than 800 (in daytime),
LED goes off. However, if the value is less than 800, LED will
automatically light on.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st55.png
   :alt: img

--------------

\**Various conditions can adopt this type of system. Thanks to its
photoresistor, it is able to detect the light intensity in day or at
night, which saves energy and intellectualize the whole system. \*\*

--------------

.. _4.2.2-FAQ:

4.2.2 FAQ
^^^^^^^^^

**Q: The value of the photoresistor cannot be 0.**

A: In actual life, little light exists although you turn off all lights
in your room, so the value of photoresistor only approaches to 0 rather
than equals to 0.

--------------

**Q: After uploading code, LED doesn't light up even though the room is
dark without lights.**

A: Increase the determined value of photoresistor. In our example, we
set to 800. So you may adjust it to 1000 or a greater value.

.. _4.3-Project-:-Alarm-System:

4.3 Project : Alarm System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this project, we use a PIR motion sensor and a buzzer to consist an
alarm system, which can be controlled by ESP32 development board.

How does it work? The electric signals are detected and read by the PIR
motion sensor through programming on Arduino IDE, and then it determines
whether there is a person. If there is, the buzzer alarms. In this way,
this alarm system costs much lower for families and offices.

.. _4.3.3-Buzzer:

4.3.3 Buzzer
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description:**

A buzzer is an electronic sounder, which emits sounds with different
frequencies and durations and is powered by DC voltage. Thus, it can be
used as a reminder or an alarm in considerable electronic devices, such
as computers, printers, copiers, alarms, electronic toys, automotive
electronics, telephones and timers.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou34.png
   :alt: img

--------------

A buzzer consists of **vibration device** and **resonance device**. And
there are two categories: Passive buzzers and active buzzers.

-  A **Passive Buzzer** cannot ``vibrate`` to emit sound itself, unless
   putting a ``square wave`` signal with a certain frequency. Moreover,
   the emitting sound varies due to the different frequency of square
   wave, so a passive buzzer can simulate tunes.

   -  An analog squire wave can be generated by changing the power level
      at pins. For example, after the high level lasting for 500ms, it
      shifts to a low level for another 500ms then to a high level
      again...
   -  \**We drive the buzzer via a squire wave within 200~5000Hz, and we
      can compute the frequency(f): *f=1/T*; T is the period (the total
      time of high and low level). \*\*

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou35.png
   :alt: img

-  An **Active Buzzer** is able to emit sound automatically without an
   external motivator, because it includes a driving circuit which only
   needs ``DC power supply``. However, its sound is flat with relatively
   fixed frequency.

--------------

**In this experiment, a passive buzzer is applied to" play music".**

--------------

**Schematic Diagram:**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou38.png
   :alt: img

**Parameters:**

-  Voltage: 3~5V
-  Current: ≤5mA
-  Power: ≤25mW

--------------

**Wiring Diagram:**

**Connect the buzzer to io16.**

**Attention: Connect yellow to S(Signal), red to V(Power), and black to
GND. Do not reverse them!**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/couj32.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**Test Code:**

**Method 1: Analog Squire Wave**

A passive buzzer is driven by squire waves, so we stimulate the wave.

An analog squire wave can be generated by changing the power level of
pin: high level for 500us and low level for 500us. So, the buzzer will
emit sound. Also, the durations can adjust the sound volume.

Please try 1000us, 1500us, 3000us…What's the difference?

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou36.png
   :alt: img

Code:

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st58.png
   :alt: img

-  In delay function, the time unit us micro-seconds. So the following
   block represents a 500ms delay.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st59.png
   :alt: img

According to formula:

.. math:: f = 1/T

Thus, 500us is the duration, and we can calculate the frequency = 2kHz,
i.e., the high and low level alter 2000 times per second.

--------------

**Method 2: Speaker Blocks**

We adopt Speaker\ |image24| code blocks to drive the buzzer to vibrate.

**Speaker Blocks generates PWM signal with a certain frequency to drive
the buzzer to vibrate,** and the duration and tone is controlled by
related parameters.

There are two ways to define the duration. One is to adjust the
parameters of the tone() function to set a duration, and the other is to
adopt a noTone() function to directly stop the sound. If you do not
define a duration in tone(), the sound signal will always be generated
unless a noTone() stops it.

For ESP32 board, one sound can only be produced at a time. If one pin of
ESP32 is generating a sound signal via tone(), it is not acceptable to
emit sound by this function on another pin.

**Tone Table**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou37.png
   :alt: img

Code:

-  Drag a "**Tone**" block from |image25| as shown below, and set pin to
   IO16.

      :alt: img

-  You may select a frequency at will.

.. _4.5.1-Description:

4.5.1 Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Solar panel converts solar power into electricity for the LED. It is
suitable for multiple applications, such as outdoor lighting, mobile
devices charging, and back up power. Hence, you may establish a
sophisticated and efficient solar power system according to your own
needs.

--------------

.. _4.5.2-Working-Principle:

4.5.2 Working Principle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**How does solar panel convert solar power into electricity?**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou52.png
   :alt: img

The solar panel absorbs light and directly or indirectly converts solar
radiation into electricity. Compared with ordinary coal power
generation, solar, wind and water power are more energy-saving and
environment-friendly.

--------------

**How does light convert to electricity?**

Next, let's talk about the conversion process from inside to outside in
a solar panel .

**The Sun emits energy in waves with a wide range of wavelengths, from
ultraviolet to visible to infrared light.**

-  Wavelength of Ultraviolet: 150~400nm;
-  Wavelength of Visible Light: 400~760nm;
-  Wavelength of Infrared Light: 760~4000nm;

**The panel absorbs one of these ranges of wavelength and converts them
into electricity. But how? Let's move on.**

--------------

**The active part of most solar panel cell is made of a semiconductor
--- silicon(Si).**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou53.png
   :alt: img

The conductivity of a semiconductor is between a conductor and an
insulator in atmospheric temperature. Generally, it cannot conduct well,
yet its conductivity improves in certain conditions.

--------------

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou54.png
   :alt: img

**The diagram above shows the internal structure of the semiconductor in
solar cell, which is divided into three layers:**

#. **The top layer (red part)** consists of Silicon(Si) and a little
   Phosphorus(P). The later carries more electrons than the former,
   providing sufficient electrons for the top layer. Due to these
   freely-moving electrons, this layer is conductive, so it is called
   **Negative or N-type.**
#. **The middle layer (gray part)** contains too few electrons to
   conduct.
#. **The bottom layer (green part)** mainly includes Silicon(Si) and
   Boron(B). The later carries less electrons than the former, so that a
   rarely few electrons move freely, causing the missing of electrons
   which are described as effective positive charge. Therefore, this
   layer is named **Positive or P-type.**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou55.png
   :alt: img

**Usually, only the middle layer of the solar panel absorbs light waves
with wavelength of 350~1140nm.** According to the spectrum distribution
in previous paragraphs, absorptions are long wave ultraviolet, short
wave infrared and visible light.

**The wavelength of ultraviolet is so short that they stops on the
surface.**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou56.png
   :alt: img

**The wavelength of infrared light is too long too be absorbed by the
panel, so they usually passes through or is reflected back.**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou57.png
   :alt: img

The middle layer absorbs light and knocks electrons off from silicon in
the top layer, leaving them in a free state, and empty electron holes
are generated at the place where they were before.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou58.gif
   :alt: img

The holes carries a positive charge. Meanwhile, free electrons move
upwards to reach N-type layer, while holes move downwards to reach
P-type layer.

**In conclusion, electrons in the top and bottom layers are struck out
after the middle layer absorbing solar energy. Therefore, N-type layer
carries negative charge as a negative pole, while P-type layer is
positively charged as a positive pole. In this case, as long as the two
layers are connected, it conducts.**

--------------

If sunlight shines on the solar panel, the above situation will last,
and a large number of free electrons and holes will be produced. As our
conclusion goes, electrons move upwards while holes move downwards,
which forms the two poles and generates current.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou59.gif

--------------

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou510.png
   :alt: img

Solar energy is an alternative energy source, which features
sustainability and cost-effectiveness.

However, the electricity generated by one solar panel can be converted
into several watts of power, which is enough for a calculator or a
cellphone charger, yet not nearly enough to run a one-kilowatt toaster.

Solar power systems satisfy the needs of different users and benefit for
environment as well. Combined with Arduino programming, this kind of
system builds a variety of useful and efficient solar applications, like
automatic lighting, chargers and smart homes.

Generally speaking, solar energy promises well for a wonderful and
sustainable future.

4.6.2 Servo
^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description:**

**Servo**, also called **RC Servo Device**, is a motor with a feedback.
Commonly, Servo performs precise position control and outputs high
torque, which most often appears in robotics projects, RC cars,
airplanes and aircraft.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou64.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**Internal Structure:**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou61.png
   :alt: img

-  ① Signal(S): It receives the control signal from microcontroller.
-  ② Potentiometer: the feedback part of the Servo. It measures the
   position of output shaft.
-  ③ Embedded board (Internal controller): the core of the Servo. It
   processes external control signal and the feedback signal of position
   and drives the Servo.
-  ④ DC motor: the execution part. It outputs speed, torque and
   position.
-  ⑤ Gear system: It scales the outputs from motor to the final output
   Angle ccording to a certain transmission ratio.

--------------

**Drive the Servo:**

Signal(S) receives PWM to control the output of Servo, and **the
position of output shaft directly relies on the duty cycle of PWM**.

For instance:

-  If we send a signal with pulse width of 1.5ms to Servo, its
   shaft(horn) will revolves to the middle position(90°);
-  If pulse width = ``0.5ms``, the shaft turns to its minimum(0°);
-  If pulse width = ``2.5ms``, the shaft turns to its maximum(180°).

**NOTE: The maximum angle varies from the types of Servos. Some are 170°
while some are only 90°. In spite of this, Servos usually will move a
half (of the maximum) if they receive a signal with pulse width of
1.5ms.**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou62.png
   :alt: img

The period of a Servo usually lasts 20ms and it produce pulses at a
frequency of ``50Hz``. Most servos work normally at 40~200Hz.

**Connect the Servo to io26.**

**Attention: Connect yellow to S(Signal), red to V(Power), and black to

rotation is enough to completely close the box.**

-  80°: fully open
-  120°: half open
-  180°: close

The frequency of sound waves that the human can hear is 20Hz ~ 20KHz,
while ultrasonic waves are beyond that range.

**Ultrasonic:**

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou66.png
   :alt: img

Ultrasonic module converts electricity and ultrasonic wave into each
other by piezoelectric effect, and it also transmits and receives
ultrasonic wave.

This kind of wave features directivity, strong penetration and easy
concentration of sound energy.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou67.png
   :alt: img

In this ultrasonic ranging system, we firstly program on MCU(ESP32
development board) to generate an original square wave at 40KHz and
drive the ultrasonic module to emit it. Immediately, the module
calculates the distance to the object after receiving the reflected
wave(Echo) amplified and shaped by the circuit. Herein, it records the
duration of emission and reflection and calculates the distance
according to the time difference.

Simply, MCU controls the module to emit ultrasonic wave which is bounced
back after encountering obstacles and is received by the module. The
time difference between them is an important factor in computing the
distance (the speed of sound propagation in air is 340m/s).

4.7.2 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description:**

DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor outputs digital signals. It
applies principles of analog signal acquisition and conversion as well
as temperature and humidity sensing technology, so that it features
long-term stability and high reliability. Besides, the sensor integrates
a high-precision resistive humidity sensor and a resistive
thermosensitive temperature sensor, and is connected with an 8-bit
high-performance MCU.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou71.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**DHT11 Communication Means:**

DHT11 communicates through monobus(a single bus) which exchanges and
controls data.

-  Monobus transmits **Data Bit**:

   -  Data format of monobus: transmit 40bit data every time, and
      high-bit first.
   -  8bit humidity integer value + 8bit humidity decimal value + 8bit
      temperature integer value + 8bit temperature decimal value + 8bit
      parity.
   -  **NOTE: Humidity decimal value equals 0.**

-  **Paraty Bit**:

   -  8bit humidity integer value + 8bit humidity decimal value + 8bit
      temperature integer value + 8bit temperature decimal value.
   -  8bit parity equals the end 8 bits of the result.

**Timing Diagram:**

\**NOTE: \*\*

**The host always reads the temperature and humidity values of last
measurement from DHT11. Therefore, If the interval between two
measurements is long, please consecutively detect twice and adopt the
second result.**

.. _4.7.3-LCD-1602-Module:

4.7.3 LCD 1602 Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description:**

LCD 1602 possesses a standard 14-pin (without back light) or 16-pin
(with back light) interface, saving the pins of MCU. Its display drives
IC to realize I2C control.

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou72.png
   :alt: img

--------------

**I2C Serial Communication:**

I2C communication, known fully as Inter-Integrated Circuit (IIC) or
Two-Wire Interface (TWI), is a commonly-used dual-bus (a host and a
slave) communication protocol, which is developed by Phillips
Semiconductor (purchased by US NXP Semiconductors).

The biggest advantage is that only two wires complete the transmission
of data, which largely simplifies circuits. In total, I2C bus can
connect 127 nodes in parallel, so it supports multiple hosts and slaves.

Generally, external power supply is needless for slaves, as I2C bus will
transmit the power to them:

.. image:: ./scratch_img/cou75.png
   :alt: img

I2C bus transmits data via 8-bit data transmission. Usually,
one-byte-data is composed of nine clock signals, eight of which transmit
data and the last one marks the end of transmission.

Moreover, I2C bus supports multi-byte data transmission by repeating the
above process continuously.

I2C Protocol basically consists of:

-  **Starting signal**: Before transmission, sender transmits a starting
   signal to inform receiver of starting point.
-  **Address**: It notifies receiver to whom the data is being sent.
-  **Data**: It is transmitted one byte each time and bit by bit.
-  **Ending Signal**: When finishing transmission, sender ends data with
   an ending signal to inform receiver that process is over.

**Timing Diagram of Serial Protocol:**

protocol, in which functions can be directly called to communicate with
I2C/TWI devices.

--------------

**Test Code:**

-  Set fan pin **INA**

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st96.png

-  Set fan pin **INB**.

   .. image:: ./scratch_img/st98.png
      :alt: img

-  Set the analog output at **INB**, which decides the rotation speed.

   -  When INA is at high, the lower the analog output at INB is, the
      faster the fan will rotate.

   -  When INA is at low, the greater the analog output at INB is, the
      faster the fan will rotate.

**Test Result:**

When the temperature reaches 29°C, the fan will turn on to dissipate
heat. When it is lower than 29°C, the fan will turn off (the fan just
simulates heat dissipation, so the effect is not good), which saves
energy for the farm.

^^^^^^^^^

#Q: Is temperature and humidty sensor waterproof?

A: No. It detects the ambient temperature and humidity (in the air), so
please do not put it in water.

--------------

#Q: ESP32 board is reset when fan rotates.

A: When fan rotates, more current is required than other sensors, hence
voltage and current may fluctuate in the circuit. Especially at the
moment of fan reversal, fluctuations may be too heavy, resulting in a
reset due to extremely low voltage and current in ESP32 development
board.

We connect the two sensors on ESP32 development board and program to
read their output values to control the relay and water pump.

If the soil is very dry, the relay will turn on to control the water
pump to irrigate plants; And if the water level is too low, the water
pump will not be able to work, and the buzzer will alarm. In this way,
plant watering and water level controlling are automatized, which raises

4.10.4 FAQ
^^^^^^^^^^

Q: Are the modules waterproof?

A: The relay module is not, yet the water pump is. The waterproof grade
of the water pump is IP68.

--------------

Q: ESP32 board is reset when the water pump works.

A: When water pump works, more current is required than other modules,
hence voltage and current may fluctuate in the circuit. Sometimes
fluctuations may be too heavy, resulting in a reset due to extremely low
voltage and current in ESP32 development board.

When operating the water pump, please follow the example code:

.. image:: ./scratch_img/st127.png

--------------

Q: Fail to pump water?

A: Several pumping operations are required to fill the water pump before
using it. These initial pumpings do not actually draw the water, but to
introduce sufficient water into the pump. Only after the pump is full
can water be carried out. So we are first for filling, not pumping.

**Arduino IDE provides you wih library file <WiFi.h>, which support
Wi-Fi configurations and ESP32 Wi-Fi networking monitoring.**

-  **Base station mode** (STA or Wi-Fi client-side mode): In this mode,
   ESP32 connects to the Wi-Fi hotspot (AP).
-  **AP mode** (Soft-AP or Wi-Fi hotspot mode): In this mode, other
   Wi-Fi devices connect to ESP32.
-  **AP-STA mode**: In this mode, ESP32 is a Wi-Fi hotspot as well as a
   Wi-Fi device connecting to another Wi-Fi hotspot.
-  These modes is compatible with multiple safe modes, like WPA, WPA2
   and WEP.
-  It is able to scan for Wi-Fi hotspot, including active and passive
   scan.
-  It supports promiscuous mode to monitor IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi Packets.

With the ESP32 development board, we have learned how to create a web
page to display the sensor values, like temperature, humidity, water
level and soil humidity, and we can also control LED lights, fans,
feeding boxes and pumps. Moreover, these operations can be remotely
finished through mobile phones or computers.

In this project, we stimulate a smart farm with intelligent and remote
management. Such technology facilitates the control of equipments and
improves agricultural efficiency and quality, which make Internet of
Things, informatization, automation and intelligence possible.

4.11.4 FAQ
^^^^^^^^^^

Q: Wifi always fails to be connected.

A: Move ESP32 to the side of the router and reboot the board, and just
be patient to wait. If it still fails to connected, please check whether
the WiFi name and password are correct.

--------------

Q: The response is slow during remote opterations on web page.

A: Possible reasons:

-  The router CPU resources are insufficient due to multiple
   connections. Please reboot the router to try a reconnection.
-  The router works for a long time. Please reboot the router.
-  Wireless interference. Wireless signal is unstable, so please do not
   use it through the wall.

For knowledge of routers, please Google by yourself.

--------------

Q: Fail to pump water?

A: Several pumping operations are required to fill the water pump before
using it. These initial pumpings do not actually draw the water, but to
introduce sufficient water into the pump. Only after the pump is full
can water be carried out. So we are first for filling, not pumping.
